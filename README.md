# Strudel

An experiment in a different way to construct stream-based, functional mobile apps.

## Goals

The primary goal is to answer the question: assumming a starting point of modern, touchscreen mobile devices, what does a productive self-hosted app development environment look like?

Key secondary goals are:
* provide an observable and testable runtime environment
* visually declarative interface for reactive stream processing
* version control without requiring directly manipulating textual representations of the configuration state

## Prior Art

Strongly influenced by the inspirational talks and articles of Brett Victor and the practical implementation of Ethan's Jasonette.

## Technology

Initial implementation is built Flutter.
